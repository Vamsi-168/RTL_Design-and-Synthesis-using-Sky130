# RTL_Design-and-Synthesis-using-Sky130
This repository documents my learning journey through a 10-day workshop on RTL Design and Synthesis using the Sky130 PDK. It covers practical aspects of Verilog-based RTL design, with a focus on how design choices translate to silicon implementation. It also explores the synthesis process and its impact on downstream stages in the ASIC design flow.
Whether you're a beginner or brushing up on fundamentals, there's a lot to explore here. Let’s dive into the world of silicon design—exciting things ahead!
